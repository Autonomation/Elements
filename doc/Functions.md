# Making Hypar Functions

Hypar Functions are the building blocks of Hypar. They capture a piece of intelligence: the logic of some system, object, or process. Hypar functions can be created in a number of different ways: you can write C# Code, build an Excel spreadsheet, or develop a Grasshopper script. 

By uploading a function to Hypar you can produce multiple options for a building problem in just a few seconds, and combine them with other people's functions to create rich, realistic designs. In this introduction to Hypar, we'll work with a much simpler function that generates masses of variable dimensions.
