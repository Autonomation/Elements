# Hypar

Hypar is a cloud platform for generating buildings.

The Hypar platform enables AEC software developers to externalize and deploy their expertise as cloud services. They can make those services available to their team, their organization, or to the world. 

Hyparâ€™s web application enables users to build generative workflows with those services, execute those workflows at scale, visualize results, and integrate those results with their existing authoring tools.
