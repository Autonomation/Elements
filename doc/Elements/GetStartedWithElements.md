- Elements is free of dependencies on host applications like Rhino or Revit.
- Elements has an API that takes the best parts from the various object models and programming APIs available in the AEC space.
- Elements can serialize data to formats like JSON, IFC,and glTF, that are useful to architects, engineers, contractors, and people building real-time visualization applications for AEC.
- Elements is written in C# which which supports code re-use in other popular AEC applications like Dynamo, Grasshopper, Revit, and Unity.
